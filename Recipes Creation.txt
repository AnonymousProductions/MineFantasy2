//HOW TO CREATE RECIPE IMAGES//
-Recipe images are included in the Recipes folder, and are organised properly.
Most Recipes (Anvil and carpenter) follow this pattern.

Before you do anything: enable debug mode (there's a special code to use in config, as me for that
if you're a tester), this will change guis to show what block is needed up top

First: Assemble the recipe in-game, only using stack sizes of 1 in the grid, and make sure
the result(in proper size) is in the result slot. If your recipe makes 2 items, put
2 in the result. Also make sure the progress bar is empty.

Take a screenshot of the gui and save it, now follow these steps to display it correctly.

1: Shift the image
   (-506x, -154y)

2: Crop the image
   (352x, 225y)

3: Save it under the item's name in the recipes folder.

knowledge.title=
knowledge.title.desc=
knowledge.title.1=

knowledge.gettingStarted=Getting Started
knowledge.gettingStarted.desc=From the ground-up
knowledge.gettingStarted.1=This is where you start working on MineFantasy. At this stage, it's recommended you atleast have a hole to live in and somewhere to build, as well you should have a supply of wood, coal, copper, stone and hide. With these resources you can begin. To start in your world you will need to ready the three main processes.
knowledge.gettingStarted.2=Crafting blocks require some interaction on your part to function. First: Set up the recipe as instructed(heating items for anvils). Then select the correct tool with the correct tier (such as fists, knives, hammers, etc). You will then need to click the block with the item keeping hits about a second apart until it finishes.
knowledge.gettingStarted.hcc=$hHardcore Crafting-$r^Hardcore crafting appears to be active. Regular tools are less effective and its recommended that primitive tools are crafted. See the Artisanry section for all the tools.
knowledge.gettingStarted.hcc2=To start off: Punch some stone... no really, break stone bare-handed (meaning no item held) and Sharp Rocks will be dropped. Use these to break some leaves for vines and sticks, and logs for wood.
knowledge.gettingStarted.carpenter=$hCarpenter Bench-$r^The carpenter bench is a basic crafting table for a selection of recipes. The tools needed for this vary and some recipes require bare fists. See the crafting tools section for more information on tools.
knowledge.gettingStarted.tanning=$hTanning-$r^By now you likely would have gathered some hide you can't use. Tanning is a simple method of creating leather from hide.^To start off, build a shabby tanning rack and a stone knife. These tools are poor quality and should be upgraded when convinient.
knowledge.gettingStarted.forging=$hForging-$r^Forging is the main method of crafting. Pretty much every tool and metal object is made through this process. Start off by making a stone forge, anvil and tools. Place the anvil near the forge and some water. The artisanty tab has an entry of how forging works. Be sure to make a basic
knowledge.gettingStarted.forging.2=firestarter (Dry rocks-Craft-Tools), and wear an apron too!
knowledge.gettingStarted.3=Now you need some leather strips for tools. Gather 2 copper, 2 planks and 1 leather to craft a set of copper shears.
knowledge.gettingStarted.4=With these shears, you can cut leather to strips on the carpenter's bench OR a tanning rack by right-clicking them on the block with leather on it.
knowledge.gettingStarted.5=At this point: You now should have access to leather, copper, planks and strips. It is now possible to upgrade that stone hammer!
knowledge.gettingStarted.6=With your forge set up, you can now craft some copper tools. Check the "Forged Tools" Section for some copper alternatives.^Make sure to use tongs when handling hot items of course by right-clicking forge/anvil with tongs held.
knowledge.gettingStarted.upgrade=$hUpgrading-$r^Basic crummy old copper will only get you so far, soon enough you will want more. The research book and table allows you to expand on what can be made and how.^To start off, make a research table
knowledge.gettingStarted.7=The research table processes scrolls to finished research pieces. Before that though, you need a scroll.^Open your book, there's a bunch of researchable entries highlighted green, go to artisanry and "Light Armour" for example, this doesn't have any prerequisites.
knowledge.gettingStarted.8=Purchase the research and you will get a scroll, put that on the research table. The metre will slowly fill up, you can speed the process by stedily hitting it (this is faster in proximity to bookshelves). When complete, right-click the new scroll.
knowledge.gettingStarted.9=Of course not all research is this easy, some takes a lot of times and you may want to craft talismans to speed the process up. Most research takes skill, your skills are displayed in the research book and increase when you use them.
knowledge.gettingStarted.10=Soon enough you will need to work with dusts, either in cooking, engineering or artisanry. Most dusts are made with a quern in clay pots.
knowledge.gettingStarted.11=Try work towards "Bronze Smithing" now, crucibles are already known as you see. For this you will need 5 "Artisanry". You gain artisanry from crafting tools, weapons, armour and some commodities.^Once bronze smithing is researched, try upgrade your tools and start the road to the next endevour.
knowledge.gettingStarted.12=$hSalvage-$r^If you've found yourself low on useful resources and/or high on unused junk; give the salvage station a go.^This small, portable block allows retrival of components from objects.
knowledge.gettingStarted.13=To use: Just place the block and drop an item on top of it, then right-click the block. (Only Basic game, and Minefantasy items can be salvaged).
knowledge.gettingStarted.14=This is pretty much the basics, the rest is for you to find out...

knowledge.dust=Grinding Powders
knowledge.dust.desc=Technique for Dusts
knowledge.dust.1=You may be able to hold a pinch or so of dust in your hand, but there's no control for how much, or how to keep it from spilling. Clay Pots are used for carrying dusts and powders for many purposes, most dust is made with the quern, while very few recipe may use other tools. Here are some examples:
knowledge.dust.quern=To use the quern: all you need is to put clay pots in the middle, the correct item in the top, then click the top of the block.
knowledge.dust.icing=Some food based recipes (like Icing) are made from multiple ingreedents and mixed.

knowledge.research=Research Book
knowledge.research.desc=Keeping track
knowledge.research.1=The research book doubles off as an unlocking section as well as a "What do I do now!". Here you can view different pieces of content including what they do as well as how their obtained.^Although a lot of this stuff is unavailable and researching is required to unlock them.
knowledge.research.2=If an icon is green: It can be unlocked: Click it to view what is needed, gather these items and hit "Purchase" to unlock the entry. And then: you will need to take it to a $hResearch Table$r to process the knowledge. This takes time, but is faster if you contribute.
knowledge.research.3=The research table is used to process scrolls. When you select a research to conduct, you must also spend time to actually figure it out, obviously. Put your scroll onto the research table slot and it will start to process. This takes a long time, but you can click it to speed it up... slowly.

knowledge.carpenter=Carpenter Bench
knowledge.carpenter.desc=Simple crafting
knowledge.carpenter.1=The carpenter bench is used for mostly wood related recipes, but should be built early on anyway. This bench can use a variety of tools such as bare hands(no item), hammers, and knives just to name a few. To use this, just assemble the recipe and click the block slowly with the proper tool.

knowledge.salvage=Salvage Station
knowledge.salvage.desc=Always Recycle
knowledge.salvage.1=There may be some advantages for being a hoarder in a harsh land, but there's really no use for all that unused furniture... or those inferior tools.^Salvaging stations can recover raw materials from many created items (Either Vanilla or MF).
knowledge.salvage.2=To use: Place the block and drop an item on top of it, right-click the block to salvage, there's a chance of recovering everything but it's not guaranteed. Damaged items have lower recovery rates.
knowledge.salvage.3=If you use a hammer on the block, there's a higher chance for returning items.^Saws are even more effective.

knowledge.talisman=Knowledge Talismans
knowledge.talisman.desc=Easy reading
knowledge.talisman.1=Figuring out the essentials of how something works can be difficult. Normally: Using the research table takes a lot of time and effort to get what you want. Talismans can speed up this process when right-clicked on a table.
knowledge.talisman.2=Greater talismans are rare and hardly used. These work like normal talismans only have infinite uses. You can also make books from them to max any skill.

knowledge.commodities=Commodities
knowledge.commodities.desc=Useful Items
knowledge.commodities.1=Commidities are just basic items, only without the disgrace of calling them junk.^^In other words: these items will be greatly used in recipes, so it's good to stock up.
knowledge.commodities.plank=Timber planks are nice solid pieces of wood. Used pretty much everywhere.
knowledge.commodities.refinedplank=Some timber can be refined with a simple mixture, hardening its finish. Refined timber will be used for more advanced works. Only tier 1 woods can be used.
knowledge.commodities.flux=Flux is commonly used in refining metals. Standard flux can be used in devices such as blast furnaces for refining ingots. Strong flux is used in advanced alloys.
knowledge.commodities.hunks=For the smaller creations, hunks are used. You can turn ingots into hunks, and back to ingots.
knowledge.commodities.nail=Nails are basic items used in woodworking. They can be made from Copper, Tin, Bronze, Iron or Steel. (This doesn't affect quality, just amount made)
knowledge.commodities.rivet=Rivets are similar to nails, these are used in metalworking. They can be made from Copper, Tin, Bronze, Iron or Steel. (This doesn't affect quality, just amount made)
knowledge.commodities.leatherstrip=Leather strips are useful mainly in tool crafting.
knowledge.commodities.thread=Thread is used in sewing recipes. Thread can be turned into string
knowledge.commodities.bucket=Buckets can be made from metal, higher tiers make more.

knowledge.plants=Biological Gen
knowledge.plants.desc=Organic resources
knowledge.plants.1=A common sight on the surface is a variety of tree and plantlife that can prove valuable for the right purposes.^Here are the plants found on the surface that can provide food and ingreedient when needed.
knowledge.plants.2=Trees provide different types of wood, some better for certain purposes than others. This is a list of the trees found in the world.
knowledge.yew.1=Yew trees are an uncommon sight in moderate regions. Their pretty average across the board but highly flexible. Yew bows are the most powerful varieties craftable.
knowledge.ironbark.1=Ironbark is more common than yew and is a rewarding sight for those seeking strong wooden materials. Ironbark can be found in hot, dry areas as well as forests and are recognised by their slim leaves and durable orange wood.
knowledge.ebony.1=Ebony trees are huge and rare. These are found in moderate regions and provide extremely strong timber. Ebony trees are recognised by their size and dark brown to black wood.^Ebony trees are the strongest wood available.

knowledge.berry=Berries
knowledge.berry.desc=Nature's snack
knowledge.berry.1=Berries generate throughout the world if the temperature and rainfall is right. These are a common sight in forests.^Juicy(purple) berries are less common drops, and cure poison.

knowledge.ores=Geological Gen
knowledge.ores.desc=Earthed resources
knowledge.ores.1=There is a small range of ores that generate in the world. Each of these can be smelted into ingots in one way or another.
knowledge.ores.copper=Copper ore is a common occurence between layers 48-96. It can easily be smelted into ingots and turned into tools.^Copper can also be used to make bronze
knowledge.ores.tin=Tin is about half as common as copper but can be found in the same levels (48-96).^Tin is smelted into ingots and is used with copper to make bronze.
knowledge.ores.silver=Silver is found in the same areas as gold from layers <32. It's not very useful early on but more uses may be discovered.
knowledge.ores.wolframite=Wolframite is a rare substance, used for high-tech engineering purposes. It can be found in layers <16 in single block veins.
knowledge.ores.mythic=Little is known about this "Mythic ore" only that it is somewhat rare and found near bedrock. This strange ore seems to emit tingling sounds, for what reason is unknown...

knowledge.ores.2=Minerals also can be found generating within the world. Unlike ores: these can't be smelted into ingots, but have other uses instead.
knowledge.minerals.clay=Just as well as sand, clay can be found within dirt. Dirt-bearing clay can be found underneath grass, grass cannot grow on it either so it can be easy to find in hills.
knowledge.minerals.kaolinite=Kaolinite has a rather specific use. Mixed with clay: this mineral can beef up the strength of bricks.^It is found near the surface at layers 48-72 and although it's uncommon, comes in large vein sizes.
knowledge.minerals.limestone=A common source of flux. Limestone generates in large hunks throughout the world.
knowledge.minerals.borax=This is a relitively rare substance, Borax is the best source of strong flux: which is needed for powerful alloys.^This is a rare find but can be found at layers 48-96.
knowledge.minerals.nitre=A common occurance within some cave walls in layers 16-64. Nitre is used in explosive creation.
knowledge.minerals.sulfur=Sulfur is found deep underground near lava at layers <16. It can be used to make explosives.

knowledge.chimney=Smoke and Chimneys
knowledge.chimney.desc=What greenhouse gasses?
knowledge.chimney.1=It is a well-known fact that burning fuel produces smoke. You will also need to understand that breathing smoke is not wise.^But if you're reading this you probably already figured that out after attempting to smoke it like a pipe.^In any case: Chimneys can be used to
knowledge.chimney.2=redirect smoke away from your precious breathing air and into the sky! Leave it for someone else a few centuries later to complain about.
knowledge.chimney.3=Extractor chimneys can also be used on some devices (forge and crucible mainly) to absorb smoke indirectly.^"Indirectly" of course just means 1 block adjacent to where it normally would go.

knowledge.tanning=Tanning
knowledge.tanning.desc=Dead animal working
knowledge.tanning.1=Leather is a useful resource to have. Nearly any tool, weapon or armour uses leather.^Tanning is a simple method of cleaning up raw hide into a useable commodity.^To start off: You will need a tanning rack.
knowledge.tanning.2=To tan hide you first need to clean it. Either right-click the hide on water or put flux and hide on a crafting grid. When cleaned; right-click the tanning rack with hide to place it. then right-click with a knife steadily to prepare. For shabby tanning racks: there's a 1/10 chance to break the block.
knowledge.tanning.3=A properly crafted tanning rack however does not break. It's recommended to craft these when their affordable.

knowledge.stamina=Stamina Mechanics
knowledge.stamina.desc=Keep fit
knowledge.stamina.1=It's not so easy to be running and mining all day you know. Stamina mechanics keep track of such.^Stamina (Represented as the green bar on the screen) decays when perfoming a variety of actions. It regenerates naturally and its speed is modified by equipped items. MF foods can modify stamina
knowledge.stamina.2=variables and sweet food can give regeneration. It's wise to consider the effects of some heavier items and how they may fit with your play style.

knowledge.combat=Combat mechanics
knowledge.combat.desc=More than one way to slay a skeleton
knowledge.combat.1=You may have noticed that constantly swinging aimlessly at monsters without a care in the world has lost it's effect some times. Combat (being a thing that you just have to deal with some times) has been modified to incorperate more complicated techniques.
knowledge.combat.2=Not only that but monsters can also use these meaning a zombie with a weapon is more dangerous than ever, as they can block attacks, power attack, and use other abilities mentioned.
knowledge.parry.info=$hParrying and Blocking$r^When holding right-click on most weapons, you block, simple right? Well now: blocking is much more effective. When you block an attack from straight-up, you immidiately reduce(and can remove) the damage of the hit, blades are best at this while hafted weapons
knowledge.parry.info2=(like axes and blunt) take damage based on the hit.^It is recommended to block attacks rather than try take them, this technique can save lives.^Attacking directly after a parry does reduce damage however.
knowledge.advparry.info=$hParrying abilities$r^When a parry succeeds: if you're holding shift, you will lunge forward, and even past an attacker, throwing them your way. This consumes stamina but timed right, can change the battlefield to your favor. It is also possible to do this while jumping.
knowledge.poweratt.info=$hPower attacks$r^If you hold sneak and attack while falling down, you will attempt a power attack. A power attack cost stamina, but when it succeeds will double damage and bypass through a blocking target. This can be interrupted if attacked just before the attempt.

knowledge.smeltCopper=Copper Smithing
knowledge.smeltCopper.desc=Tier %1$s, Common material
knowledge.smeltCopper.1=The path of metalworking is a long and difficult one to learn. Copper is an easily workable and risk-free material.^It's still a piece of junk though, and is unable to make advanced tools, heavy weapons or heavy armour. But it's your piece of junk!

knowledge.smeltBronze=Bronze Smithing
knowledge.smeltBronze.desc=Tier %1$s, Common material
knowledge.smeltBronze.1=By mixing a small amount of tin with some copper, you can create bronze. This alloy is far superior to copper alone and can make advanced items.^You can now craft tools from Bronze.

knowledge.smeltIron=Iron Smithing
knowledge.smeltIron.desc=Tier %1$s, Common material
knowledge.smeltIron.1=Iron is by far the most common ore you can find and knowing how to work it makes it all the more useful. Iron tools are pretty average, yet superior to bronze.^You can now craft tools from Iron.

knowledge.smeltPig=Pig Iron
knowledge.smeltPig.desc=Iron preparation
knowledge.smeltPig.1=Natural iron is full of impurities and defects and proper refining of it is crucial to create a decent alloy. A blast furnace does just that and is able to produce pig iron.^Pig iron is used to create steel.

knowledge.smeltSteel=Steel Smithing
knowledge.smeltSteel.desc=Tier %1$s, Common material
knowledge.smeltSteel.1=Finally make that blast furnace did you? now to put it to use. This material is far stronger than iron but can be expensive.^Steel is made from pig iron from either working it on an anvil(the suckers way) or finding a way to create a fireclay curcible and throwing it in there(the easy way).

knowledge.smeltEncrusted=Encrusted Smithing
knowledge.smeltEncrusted.desc=Tier %1$s, Exotic material
knowledge.smeltEncrusted.1=You can now merge the power of diamonds to the workablility of steel for some reason! Encrusted tools are much stronger and sharper than steel and are able to mine stronger blocks (like obsidian).^Now go ahead: show off your shiny new tools.

knowledge.smeltObsidian=Obsidian Smithing
knowledge.smeltObsidian.desc=Tier %1$s, Exotic material
knowledge.smeltObsidian.1=Obsidian in its natural form is extremely resistant to impact, although that in turn makes it unworkable. A mix of obsidian and steel with a certain method can produce a workable, and powerful material.

knowledge.smeltBlackSteel=Black Steel Smithing
knowledge.smeltBlackSteel.desc=Tier %1$s, Common material
knowledge.smeltBlackSteel.1=It is now possible to further refine steel into a far superior alloy. This process takes all the best qualities from lesser materials to create an extremely powerful metal.

knowledge.smeltDragonforge=Dragonforge Smithing
knowledge.smeltDragonforge.desc=Well forged
knowledge.smeltDragonforge.1=Dragons are tough creatures, and hunting them takes preparation and experience. Through your efforts, it is possible to use their own powers against them, Dragonforge weapons are more effective against damaging dragons.
knowledge.smeltDragonforge.2=To create dragonforge: Start by making any standard melee weapon. Just before finishing however: throw (right-click) a dragon heart into a nearby forge, then quickly finish the craft.^If all goes well you will have a dragonforge item.

knowledge.smeltBlueSteel=Blue Steel Smithing
knowledge.smeltBlueSteel.desc=Tier %1$s, Common material
knowledge.smeltBlueSteel.1=You are now able to create Blue Steel. This metal is extremely lighter than inferior metals and excellent for the creation of tools and armour for limiting stamina decay.

knowledge.smeltRedSteel=Red Steel Smithing
knowledge.smeltRedSteel.desc=Tier %1$s, Common material
knowledge.smeltRedSteel.1=You are now able to create Red Steel. This metal is much heavier than other materials, and tiring to use with tools and armour, but is very strong and far better than other materials of this tier.

knowledge.smeltMithril=Mithril Smithing
knowledge.smeltMithril.desc=Tier %1$s, Exotic material
knowledge.smeltMithril.1=Mythic ore is strange: Depending on how it is refined depends on what properties the metal processed is. Through mixing light elements with mythic: along with silver, you can create mithril.^Mithril is an extremely light material, even lighter than blue steel.

knowledge.smeltAdamantium=Adamantium Smithing
knowledge.smeltAdamantium.desc=Tier %1$s, Exotic material
knowledge.smeltAdamantium.1=Mythic ore is strange: Depending on how it is refined depends on what properties the metal processed is. Through mixing heavy elements with mythic: along with gold, you can create adamantium.^Adamantium is extremely heavy, more than red steel, but is very strong.

knowledge.smeltMaster=Masterwork Mythics
knowledge.smeltMaster.desc=The next level
knowledge.smeltMaster.1=The production of mythic materials is one thing, but doing it right is quite another. You may be able to create the base adamantium and mithril from mythic ore, but these materials are hardly a match for the total power held in this mineral.
knowledge.smeltMaster.2=Masterworks allows you to create powerful new tools from mythic-based materials and further enhances their power.^Crafting Masterworks isn't as straight-forward. Firstly- it is much harder to get the quality metre in balance on the anvil.
knowledge.smeltMaster.3=Not only that: but items will be rendered inferior if you make even a slight imperfection. Done correctly however; masterwork items will be indestructible so it's recommended you know what you are doing!

knowledge.smeltIgnotumite=Ignotumite Smithing
knowledge.smeltIgnotumite.desc=Tier %1$s, Master material
knowledge.smeltIgnotumite.1=Crafting adamantium can make extremely powerful tools but it doesn't quite reach its full capabilities; As you know, mythic ore is made up of many elements that swil within its structure, separating this is key to unlocking the capabilities within adamantium known as ignotumite.

knowledge.smeltMithium=Mithium Smithing
knowledge.smeltMithium.desc=Tier %1$s, Master material
knowledge.smeltMithium.1=Mithium is found deep within only the purest of mithril. This material has a structure never seen before, it is super light. The lightweight nature of mithium comes from its core, it seems to be a hollow shell that bends to forces yet does not break, inside seems to be some sort of energy that keeps the metal solid...

knowledge.smeltEnder=Enderforge Smithing
knowledge.smeltEnderforge.desc=Tier %1$s, Master material
knowledge.smeltEnderforge.1=There's always been something strange about those ender creatures... Enderforge takes the magical energies deep within the balance of mithril and admantium and focuses it using ender pearls.

knowledge.masterHaft=All masterowk materials use special rods instead of planks. For tools and weapons: Use these instead of planks.
knowledge.masterArmour=For any armour, you need to make mail and plate items differently, assembly remains the same.

knowledge.coalflux=Coal Flux
knowledge.coalflux.desc=Conservative
knowledge.coalflux.1=It's pretty certain now that those piles of coal you have don't last very long when a boat load of ore comes in. Smelting equipment just uses so much of it and it drains your supplies fast!^A mixture of flux and coal can be used in substitute for coal in bloomeries, though it doesn't work as fuel.

knowledge.blastfurn=Refining
knowledge.blastfurn.desc=More than smelting
knowledge.blastfurn.1=There's a time that comes when simply smelting ingots in a furnace just won't do the job. In this case: you will need a Blast Furnace.^Blast furnaces are both large and expensive to build. Each furnace however can be built to nearly any height and smelt multiple items at once.
knowledge.blastfurn.2=Of course before making the furnace: you will need to make a decent casing around them. For that, there's fire bricks.^Firebricks are able to sustain the extreme temperatures of the blast furnace and are used in its creation.
#Firebrick Recipes
knowledge.blastfurn.3=The furnace is made of two blocks: Heaters and Chambers. Make one heater and up to 16 chamber blocks. The more chambers you put in, the more it can smelt.
#Furnace Recipes
knowledge.blastfurn.4=Now with fire bricks, a heater, and some chambers: You can now assemble the furnace.^To start off: place the heater on the ground.^If a crucible is under the heater: It will catch the output.^Also make sure to leave plenty of room (about 4 blocks) all 4 sides.
knowledge.blastfurn.5=The heater should have firebricks on 4 corners at its level. And by the life of you: don't cover the sides.^With that ready, stack the shafts on top of the heater, and put fire bricks on all 4 sides. leaving the top exposed to the sky (or a chimney).
#Structure
knowledge.blastfurn.6=Using the blast furnace is pretty simple, but does consume a lot of fuel.^Start off by putting input (such as prepared iron) in the bottom slot and coal in the top slot of the top-most chamber block, (its recommended to use a small chimney to catch the smoke while remaining in access to
knowledge.blastfurn.7=the block). When done properly the items will fall down the chute stacking 1 per chamber. After that: put some fuel in the bottom, fuel burns regardless of smelting so it's wise to take note of how much you may need. Upon finishing: all chambers will process one item, and the heater will evacuate its pressure, leaving a spectacular
knowledge.blastfurn.8=jet of flames.^Just make sure not to obstruct these jets or the furnace could explode. And keep flammable objects away!
knowledge.blastfurn.hcc=$hHardcore Crafting-$r^With Hardcore crafting; A crucible underneath the heater is highly recommended. If not you may ruin ingots!
#Prepared Iron
knowledge.blastfurn.9=Prepared iron ore is used to make pig iron.^Pig iron can be turned into steel.^You may use strong flux to double production, but strong flux is rare and should be used wisely.

knowledge.bloomery=Bloomery
knowledge.bloomery.desc=Early Metalworks
knowledge.bloomery.1=Gaining the precious material from rock-encrusted sources isn't easy. Bloomeries allow proper smelting of ingots from raw ores.
knowledge.bloomery.2=To use: Place equal amounts of ore and coal in the block and right-click it with a firestarter. If all goes well it will start smelting, the more items it has- the slower it works.^Bloomeries must be placed outdoors, clear to sky in order to function and chimneys will not work either.
knowledge.bloomery.3=The whole stack will be smelted in this process, when finished- the top will come off and expose the bloom. Click this steadily with a hammer to finish the process, keep going until all ingots are retrieved. Make sure you're holding empty tongs when you collect the ingot.

knowledge.crucible=Alloying
knowledge.crucible.desc=Mixing metals
knowledge.crucible.1=There's only so far you can go by relying on one metal or another to fit your needs. For this: there's the crucible.^Crucibles are designed for alloying, where you can get multiple materials and mix them to make even better materials.
knowledge.crucible.2=In order to function, Crucibles need a heat source below them(such as a $hForge$r), lava also works but is very slow.^Crucible recipes are shapeless and run off "ratio".
knowledge.crucible.3=For example: 3 Bronze is 2 copper and 1 tin. This means you can put copper in 2 slots, and tin in 1, and each smelt gives 3 bronze. But you can put 4 and 2 in to get 6, and so on...
knowledge.crucible.hcc=$hHardcore Crafting-$r^With hardcore crafting however: Items cannot be retrieved from the crucible GUI. You need to craft an ingot mould, right-click this to retrieve the ingots 1 at a time, and cool them in water.^Also: If you break the crucible, outputs will be lost!

knowledge.crucible2=Advanced Alloying
knowledge.crucible2.desc=More Mixing...
knowledge.crucible2.1=Fire bricks have proven useful fore their ability to sustain high temperatures. Creating a crucible out of this means the heat of the alloy is more stable and can be used to further process materials.^Fireclay crucibles are able to create more advanced alloys.

knowledge.apron=Blacksmith Apron
knowledge.apron.desc=Protective wear
knowledge.apron.1=Forges can get hot, and so can the metals processed in them. When using a forge its recommended to wear one of these. Blacksmith attitre consists of a shirt, apron and gloves. This is suitable for forge and ingot handling. Items burn you in your inventory without these.

knowledge.anvil=Forging
knowledge.anvil.desc=The basis of metalworks
knowledge.anvil.1=Not that crafting tables are obsolete or anything but there's many better ways to craft items. Forging is the most common means to craft anything metal.^This process includes using the Forge to heat metals, and working them on an anvil using a selection of hammers.
#Recipe
knowledge.anvil.2=Anvils are simple to craft and can be recycled in a furnace.^Place the anvil on the ground, somewhere near water and a forge. Right-clicking the anvil from the side or without a hammer opens the GUI.
#Gui
knowledge.anvil.3=Crafting items can be complicated, there are two stages to crafting.^Firstly some items(mostly metal ingots and hunks) need to be heated in the $hForge$r. If an items heatable, it needs to be heated.^Secondly is the recipe itself: Start by assembling the components on the
knowledge.anvil.4=grid$h[3]$r (just as you're used to), then: equip a proper hammer (either heavy or normal depending on the recipe). Hammers need to be the proper tier but anvil tier affects quality, Tiers will appear above the title$h[1]$r.^Hit the anvil with the hammer by clicking. The progress bar$h[2]$r will now fill in, when finished: The result
knowledge.anvil.5=appears in the output slot$h[4]$r.^Some items will be hot, you can right-click them on water or a cauldron(shift click), to cool them. Right-click the anvil with tongs if you want to pick items up that way.
knowledge.anvil.tongs=Holding hot items will burn you, so when you need to pick something off the forge, right-click it with tongs, then the anvil to place.
knowledge.anvil.6=While crafting, keep track of the quality metre. The aim here is to keep the marker away from the edges. If it hits either side it ruins the recipe. When crafting damageable items however; the durability of the item is diminished if the marker is outside the pins when completing, see the next page.

#Quality
knowledge.anvil.7=As you see, there's the two green pins that damage items if the blue marker is outside, either end of the bar itself is the dead zone. Be sure to distribute a mix of left-click and right-clicks to craft an item and think ahead before hitting. also note the metre moves right slower than left.
knowledge.anvil.8=If you SHIFT-LEFT click however it will knock the metre back(to give you some more time to craft), don't exceed 0 however, or it will ruin the item.

knowledge.forge=Forge
knowledge.forge.desc=Its getting hot in here.
knowledge.forge.1=The forge is a simple device, put fuel in it (Right-click an item). and light it with a firestarter (like flint and steel).^It's easy! Just throw stuff in it and set it on fire!
knowledge.forge.2=Forges burn at different temperatures depending on the fuel, the temperature depends on the last item thrown. $hBellows$r can be used to temporarily increase the temperature.^You can place heatable items(like ingots and hunks) in the forge, and they slowly will heat up.
knowledge.forge.3=$y"WORKABLE"$r items are needed to use an anvil, $d"UNSTABLE"$r Items are too hot.^Use different fuels and bellows to get the temperature where you want it, and make sure to monitor your items.^NOTE: if a crucible(or similar) is above the forge: it cannot be accessed.

knowledge.bellows=Bellows
knowledge.bellows.desc=Heat Injection
knowledge.bellows.1=Sometimes the fire just isn't hot enough, or it may be taking to long to warm up. Using hotter fuels only takes you so far and can be wasteful when not needed.^Bellows can temporarily boost the temperature of forges by up to 50%. To use: Place them pointing at the desired block and right-click them
knowledge.bellows.2=constantly. They can also work through solid walls.

knowledge.trough=Trough
knowledge.trough.desc=Ready to Quench
knowledge.trough.1=Having to walk to or build near water sources can be tricky, and diging holes to fill your own water sources also gets annoying. Troughs are simple containers capable of quenching hot items, just right-click tongs or hot items on this. To fill: Right-click with a bucket or water jug, but make sure not to overfill it.

knowledge.repair_basic=Repair Kits
knowledge.repair_basic.desc=Keeping tools in condition
knowledge.repair_basic.1=It's likely that by now one of your precious tools has broken. And it also is likely that you looked like a right idiot when it happened.^Repair kits allow you to touch up on the durability of items when they get damaged. These kits don't repair much but do the job alright, just Right-Click the block with an item to
knowledge.repair_basic.2=eventually repair it.^There is also a chance the kit will break, limiting their uses.

knowledge.repair_advanced=Advanced Repairing
knowledge.repair_advanced.desc=Better conditioning
knowledge.repair_advanced.1=You still look silly damaging items when using repair kits... These new kits, though more expensive, can repair more items before without breaking.^They will also repair more durability.

knowledge.repair_ornate=Ornate Repair Kits
knowledge.repair_ornate.desc=Enchantment Repair
knowledge.repair_ornate.1=It may already been known that repairing enchanted items is hard. It's like they don't like being repaired or something...^Anyway this kit should do the trick, it might have more jewels in it than the thing you're fixing but it works!^picky enchanted items...

knowledge.craftArmourBasic=Basic Armor
knowledge.craftArmourBasic.desc=Nothing fancy
knowledge.craftArmourBasic.1=When you first start out in this world, you may want something to wear. These Armors don't offer much protection but their better than nothing.

knowledge.craftArmourLight=Light Armor
knowledge.craftArmourLight.desc=Cheap and practical
knowledge.craftArmourLight.1=Light armor weighs pretty much nothing and will not restrict any stamina regeneration.^It however isn't likely to protect you from much, so think about that before catching broadswords with your face. Leather armours are protective against blunt based damage.

knowledge.craftArmourMedium=Medium Armor
knowledge.craftArmourMedium.desc=Average protection
knowledge.craftArmourMedium.1=Medium armor is the base average. Nothing more to say there but the protection is decent but stamina regeneration is slowed by about half, but you should be able to take a decent whack with it. Chainmail armour is pretty effective but vulnerable to blunt based damage.
knowledge.craftArmourMedium.scale=As an alternative, Scalemail can be created. Scale armor has more balanced protection against all forms of damage, not quite as effective against piercing and cutting resistance, it makes up in blunt.

knowledge.craftArmourHeavy=Heavy Armor
knowledge.craftArmourHeavy.desc=Strong but restricted
knowledge.craftArmourHeavy.1=This stuff is strong and much like medium armor, crafted from metal. Heavy armour not only significantly slows your stamina regeneration to roughly a third, but it also increases the rate of decay. Plate is highly protective but vulnerable to piercing based damage.
knowledge.craftArmourHeavy.splint=Splintmail isn't quite as heavy as a full blown suit of plate, and has lesser protective qualities in return. However, splintmail is still far superior to medium armours and protects all damage types equally.

knowledge.craftHCCTools=Primitive Tools
knowledge.craftHCCTools.desc=(HARDCORE CRAFTING)
knowledge.craftHCCTools.1=With Hardcore Crafting active: Basic tools are not what they used to be... You need to work your way up to metal by crafting primitve stone tools first.^Primitive stone tools are made on the carpenter bench.
knowledge.craftHCCTools.2=Every Stone tool needs 3 components to make:^Sharp rocks are gained by breaking stone bare-handed (No item held).^Vines can be gained by breaking leaves with a sharp rock.^Sticks can be gained similar to vines.
knowledge.craftHCCTools.3=Stone can also be crafted from cobblestone, a hammer is first needed though.
knowledge.craftHCCTools.4=With these thee components, a carpenter bench must be made for tool crafting: It is recommended to make a pick first, as they can mine stone (processed into rocks).

knowledge.craftTools=Forged Tools
knowledge.craftTools.desc=Properly crafted
knowledge.craftTools.1=What is that? you throw a stick on some rocks and call that a tool? HA! These are how REAL tools are made!^All the goodness of normal tools only made properly, these tools have double the durability... and double the style.
knowledge.craftTools.pick=Picks can also tell you a blocks tier and if it can be mined. Just right-click a block with a forged pick.
knowledge.craftAdvTools=Advanced Tools
knowledge.craftAdvTools.desc=Fit for purpose
knowledge.craftAdvTools.1=Not only can you forge proper tools but there is also a selection of additional tools with their own uses. Most of these tools are alternatives to existing tools, only... different.

knowledge.dagger.info=Daggers are tiny little blades that... well their pretty lame really.^But their light and quick to the strike! Pretty good for a spammy-attack style.
knowledge.sword.info=A good old sword. Swords block the most damage and at the best arc. A finesse based blocking and countering style suits this weapon.
knowledge.mace.info=For a good bop across the bonce!. Maces aren't that special and blocking damages the weapon more. But they have good durability and damage.
knowledge.waraxe.info=A heavy hand axe for brutal hacking at your foes. War axes do decent damage and have bonuses when sprinting and jumping attacks. Good for the barbaric types. They also take more damage from blocking.
knowledge.spear.info=If you're too scared for close combat, spears allow you to poke them from afar.. you know like you're just pushing them away with a long stick!^Spears do more damage when sprinting
knowledge.bow.info=Standard wooden bow with metal joints.^Note that some more brittle metals (like pig iron) will lessen the damage of the item.^RIGHT-CLICK while sneaking to open the inventory. Ammo must be loaded before use.

knowledge.craftAdvWeapons=Heavy Weapons
knowledge.craftAdvWeapons.desc=Big enough?
knowledge.craftAdvWeapons.1=I'm not sure what you're intending on killing but here's some of the... larger pieces.
knowledge.katana.info=Katanas are the lightest heavy weapon and aren't much heavier than a normal sword. This weapon strikes fast and is the least tiring to use. Power attacks will also damage armour.^^Ninja approved!
knowledge.greatsword.info=A heavy, flat blade. Greatswords are the best defensive heavy weapon. Like swords: Greatswords are decent for blocking.
knowledge.warhammer.info=If you ever wanted to hit something across the skull with a weapon the size of the anvil it was made of. Warhammers pack a punch!
knowledge.battleaxe.info=For when a waraxe won't cut it (pun not intended). Battleaxes do more damage then waraxes and are heavier(obviously). for an even crazier barbaric type.^Tiring to use though
knowledge.halbeard.info=Well if a spear is too whimpy! You can put an axe on it. Halbeards do more damage than spears but are heavier.^Halbeads can stab when sprinting.
knowledge.lance.info=Lances are pretty useless as a weapon. But when mounted they do more damage based on the speed you're going.^More suited for jousting if you haven't figured that out.

knowledge.firemaker=Firemaking
knowledge.firemaker.desc=Burn it all
knowledge.dryrocks.info=Dry rocks are the most basic, and least effective method of creating fire. Banging two of these together will create a flame after awhile.
knowledge.tinderbox.info=The tinderbox is effective at starting fires and highly durable. It still may take a few tries to get a flame, but the extra uses pays off.
knowledge.flintsteel.info=This is the most effective fire starter as it works instantly. Flint and Steels have less durability than a tinder box however.

knowledge.craftCrafters=Crafting Tools
knowledge.craftCrafters.desc=That's tools for crafting
knowledge.craftCrafters.1=There's a variety of different tools for the purpose of crafting. A lot of recipes require you to interact with the block with these tools.
knowledge.hammer.info=Hammers are used mostly in forging. hammers are highly useful for both metalworks and some woodworks.
knowledge.hvyhammer.info=There also are heavier counterparts of the hammer, used for forging some of the larger metal items.
knowledge.tongs.info=Tongs are used for picking up hot items from the anvil, to transfer to a water source. Unlike simply dropping hot items, tongs will place items above the block rather than randomly about.
knowledge.knife.info=Knives can be used in cooking and tanning. Knives are useful.^^Just don't run with them.
knowledge.saw.info=Saws can cut wood into planks more efficiently. Put a planks block on a carpenter bench and hit it with a saw.^Saws also are much more effective at salvaging items.
knowledge.needle.info=Needles are used for sewing based recipes. Needles are used wherever thread is used.
knowledge.mallet.info=Mallets are not really common... It's pretty much only used where a hammer may be a bit too much. So basically: some woodworks use this.
knowledge.spoon.info=Spoons. Used for cooking, generally mixing... What else to say... it's a spoon...

knowledge.craftOrnateWeapons=Ornate Weapons
knowledge.craftOrnateWeapons.desc=Fancy
knowledge.craftOrnateWeapons.1=If you just didn't look enough like a ponce without a gleaming sword made of jewels and silver.^Ornate weapons do more damage to undead in witches, so they sizzle like saussages!^But their not good on anything else so you may be asked why you hold two swords.

knowledge.craftAdvOrnateWeapons=Heavy Ornate Weapons
knowledge.craftAdvOrnateWeapons.desc=Fancy. Er
knowledge.craftAdvOrnateWeapons.1=Ofcourse you want bigger! Because you have silver, and silver is kinda useless.^I get it.

knowledge.arrows=Fletching
knowledge.arrows.desc=Arrow crafting
knowledge.arrows.1=Crafting arrows can take some time, but still remains moderately low-cost. There are three components to an arrow: The head which you make out of metal. The fletching is made of paper and feathers to guide the arrow. And the shaft is just a stick!

knowledge.arrowsBodkin=Bodkin Arrows
knowledge.arrowsBodkin.desc=Light and fast
knowledge.arrowsBodkin.1=Bodkin heads can be fitted the same way as normal arrows. Although these arrows do less damage, they do fly much further.

knowledge.arrowsBroad=Broad arrows
knowledge.arrowsBroad.desc=Heavy and strong
knowledge.arrowsBroad.1=Broad head arrows are heavy and slow but firing them packs a punch!

knowledge.etools=Engineering Tools
knowledge.etools.desc=Tools of the trade
knowledge.etools.1=Engineering could be a delicate trade in some aspects. For that, you need tools that can handle these processes.

knowledge.ecomponents=Components and Commodities
knowledge.ecomponents.desc=For Engineering
knowledge.ecomponents.1=For engineering, there's some nifty ways you can join components. However, you may need to find some alternative commodities for doing such. It's worthwhile to make a few of these for when their needed.
knowledge.ecomponents.2=Most engineered objects aren't just forged. Construction usually takes pre-forged components and attatching them together. Components however are mostly used for specific purposes, and are better made on-site (Unless you intend to mass produce). 

knowledge.coke=Coke
knowledge.coke.desc=Refined Fuels
knowledge.coke.1=Alone, Coal is just full of impurities which reflect on poor burning capabilities. With much refinement, and the use of redstone, charcoal can be burned at a rate that completely removes all imperfections and leaves the coal in its purest form, for optimal fuel use. This process only works with charcoal however.

knowledge.tungsten=Wolframite Smithing
knowledge.tungsten.desc=Machine-Worthy Metal
knowledge.tungsten.1=There's always a limit to using iron based materials in engineering; It just cannot handle the stress some machines have applied. Wolframite is a rare metal found within lower layers of stone. The ore itself can be found in rare occasions, but can also be found by use of a handpick.
knowledge.tungsten.2=If you use a high enough tier (such as encrusted) below layer 16: It is possible to mine raw Wolframite ore.^After that, it's only a matter of refining it. Wolframite requires to be melted down with large amounts of coal and flux to separate the ore.
knowledge.tungsten.3=Although this material is highly valued to engineers, it does require some decent smithing skills to refine the ore, making it even more difficult to acquire.

knowledge.engTanner=Advanced Tanner
knowledge.engTanner.desc=Easy Tanning
knowledge.engTanner.1=Tanning is probably one of the most tiring methods of production, now you can make it easier!^This tanning rack is able to slice and dice clean hide for you. Just place the item as usual than right-click the top.

knowledge.advcrucible=Auto Crucible
knowledge.advcrucible.desc=Easy Alloys
knowledge.advcrucible.1=The technology of the crucible is rather low tec but now it is well known that harvesting the refined metals can be tedious.^These crucibles will be able to divide and cool the refined metals, ready for pickup.

knowledge.advforge=Advanced Forge
knowledge.advforge.desc=Full control
knowledge.advforge.1=Although making a basic forge is able to get anything done, its not very fuel-efficient. This redstone powered furnace allows you full control on if its lit or not. Apply a redstone signal to light it, cut the signal to extinguish.^This seems to produce heavy pollution though.

knowledge.blackpowder=Explosives
knowledge.blackpowder.desc=Boom!
knowledge.blackpowder.1=Using generic gunpowder and TNT to blow things up may be satisfying but it makes one hell of a mess. It is possible however to create devices with more controlled explosions that limit the environmental damage.^Blackpowder is an explosive substance capable of doing large damage while limiting
knowledge.blackpowder.2=the destruction of blocks.^It's not world-shatteringly powerful like the stuff creepers use.^Blackpowder is made from various minerals found while mining.

knowledge.advblackpowder=Refined Blackpowder
knowledge.advblackpowder.desc=Ka Boom!
knowledge.advblackpowder.1=Blackpowder has proven useful for explosive creation but sometimes you may need more of a blast.^Through the use of redstone and glowstone: you can beef-up the power of blackpowder to increase damage.

knowledge.climber=Climbing Pick
knowledge.climber.desc=Getting up there
knowledge.climber.1=It's getting a bit awkward having to go around mountains and find stairways up the slopes, especially so if you just fell 50 metres down a cave. A climbing pick allows you to grapple solid blocks, only complete cubes can be grappled (such as stone and grass).
knowledge.climber.2=To use this properly can be tricky. First off, hold down right-click on a block you're right up against (you can also do blocks above that). Then hit left-click to pull yourself up, holding shift and left clicking goes down. It is possible to climb sideways, and up overhangs, but is difficult.

knowledge.spyglass=Spyglass
knowledge.spyglass.desc=Yondar!
knowledge.spyglass.1=There's so much to see out there, but due to the limit of our eyes we have to walk all the way over there to see it... Not anymore.^Spyglasses allow you to see further when used, Shift-Right-Click changes the scope mode.

knowledge.parachute=Parachute
knowledge.parachute.desc=What goes up... 
knowledge.parachute.1=You may know how to get up to a high place, but some time the ground may have something to say on the matter. Parachutes allow you to safely drop from high distances, slowly.

knowledge.syringe=Syringe
knowledge.syringe.desc=Easy administer 
knowledge.syringe.1=Drinking potions is slow and awkward in emergencies. Syringes allow you to inject potions directly into your system, being useful the moment you need it. You can also shift-click on others to use on them.^To Fill: Place an empty syringe and a regular potion on a crafting grid.

knowledge.bombs=Bomb Crafting
knowledge.bombs.desc=Explosion Delivery
knowledge.bombs.1=What use is blackpowder without something to put it in? Well these little gadgets will do serious damage to a small area.^Bomb crafting is more... experimental than other works. First of all: you need a workstation set up.
knowledge.bombs.2=Now put that down... Wherever.^With this table you will be able to create both bombs and mines. Bombs can be thrown by holding right-click for a short time and they will explode at after a time. Mines however will be placed with holding right click and explode when something steps near them.
knowledge.bombs.3=Bombs and Mines require 3-4 components in their creation.^The casing$h[1]$r determines the damage and range of the device. Powder$h[2]$r will modify damage. Filling$h[3]$r can be empty and is used to add effects to the bomb. Finally the fuse$h[4]$r determines the time until detonation.
knowledge.bombs.4=To craft a bomb: simply put components in their respective slots for example cermic casing, blackpowder and a short fuse. then click the block to make a single bomb.

knowledge.crossbows=Crossbow Crafting
knowledge.crossbows.desc=Deadly Projectiles
knowledge.crossbows.1=Crossbows are a custom-made firearm capable of dealing large amounts of damage with a reliable rate. Although these are usually slower than bows, crossbows can be made with a variety of components, allowing them to excel at a wider range of purposes.
knowledge.crossbows.2=To create crossbows, you will need an assembly table.^This table allows the combination of parts to create a finished device. The traits of the crossbow depend on these 4 components (Stock, Arms, Mod and Muzzle). 
knowledge.crossbows.3=Place this bench down in the desired location. Now you will need to create parts for your crossbow (See further entries).^The Stock and Arms are required for any crossbow. Stocks affect the recoil, and reload speed of the crossbow, short handles define "Hand crossbows" which are fast and inaccurate.
knowledge.crossbows.4=You may also add both a mod and muzzle to the crossbow. Mods go on the top and can add additional functionalty (at a cost). Muzzles are mods specially designed to be fitted at the tip of the weapon (like a bayonet). It's always good not to add a mod if it's not needed.
knowledge.crossbows.5=To craft a crossbow: Place the desired parts in their respected slots. (Similar to bomb crafting) You will then need to steadily click the block with a spanner to craft the item.
knowledge.crossbows.6=When that's finished: you have a crossbow. Crossbows function differently to bows and can be fired immidiately if the weapon is ready. Sneak and use the item to open its inventory. This must be used. You can add any bolt to the inventory of the crossbow and it will load when you use it.

knowledge.crossShafts=Crossbow Stocks
knowledge.crossShafts.desc=Vital component
knowledge.crossShafts.handle=Handles are miniture stocks designed for creating hand crossbows. This small design allows fast reload speed at the cost of accuracy and recoil.
knowledge.crossShafts.stock=Stocks are full-sized versions of the Handle and are capable of firing a crossbow with less recoil. Due to their size, reduce the reload time.

knowledge.crossHeads=Crossbow Arms
knowledge.crossHeads.desc=Vital Component
knowledge.crossHeads.light=A Lightweight crossbow head allows easy reload speed at a cost of power. This head can be modified multiple times to increase its weight and power.
knowledge.crossHeads.medium=A standard sized crossbow head. This has a balanced power and speed.
knowledge.crossHeads.heavy=A heavy-duty, reinforced crossbow head. This has a massive force behind it, and it shows with a high recoil and slow reload time.

knowledge.crossHeadAdvanced=Advanced Crossbow Arms
knowledge.crossHeadAdvanced.desc=Precision over speed
knowledge.crossHeads.advanced=The Advanced crossbow head incorperates a complex design that focuses the bolt down a straight path. This head is stiff and hard to reload but can fire bolts with much less spread.
knowledge.crossShaftAdvanced=Advanced Crossbow Stock
knowledge.crossShaftAdvanced.desc=Recoil Control
knowledge.crossShafts.advanced=Upgraded from a regular stock, this heavy iron stock is capable of absorbing the energy from firing a crossbow, granting great recoil reduction.

knowledge.crossAmmo=Repeating Crossbow
knowledge.crossAmmo.desc=Expanded capacity
knowledge.crossAmmo.1=Crossbows can take time to reload, and you may need to fire more than once to get the job done. Repeating mechanisms go in the "mod" slot and allow crossbows to fire multiple shots before reloading (at a cost of accuracy)

knowledge.crossScope=Crossbow Scope
knowledge.crossScope.desc=Primitive Sniper
knowledge.crossScope.1=What use would an accurate crossbow be without the ability to see what you're shooting at. Spyglasses can now be modified to fit onto crossbows in the "mod" slot.

knowledge.crossBayonet=Crossbow Bayonet
knowledge.crossBayonet.desc=Melee Damage
knowledge.crossBayonet.1=While some reload their crossbows, it's usual for some jerk to take advantage of the situation, you need to fight back another way. Bayonets attach to the "muzzle" slot and can increase the melee damage from crossbows.

knowledge.bpress=Bomb Press
knowledge.bpress.desc=Mass Productive
knowledge.bpress.1=Having to assemble each bomb individually can be tedious... very tedious. This device can do the work for you, all you need to do is place it directly above a bomb crafting table, pull the lever and it crafts the bomb for you.

knowledge.bombarrow=Bomb Arrows
knowledge.bombarrow.desc=To pack a punch
knowledge.bombarrow.1=Your experience in the creations of bombs has paid off. These tiny explosives can be packed similar to bombs and deliver a deadly blast. Bomb arrows are created like any bomb, place the arrow casing in the case slot. These do not take fuses.

knowledge.shrapnel=Shrapnel Bombs
knowledge.shrapnel.desc=Simple Filling
knowledge.shrapnel.1=Bombs seem all well and good so far, but there seems to be room to improve. Each bomb is able to fit in a layer of filling that modifies the detonation of the device.^Shrapnel can be added in bomb crafting to increase the damage dealt from explosions.

knowledge.firebomb=Firey Explosions
knowledge.firebomb.desc=Deadly Incineration
knowledge.firebomb.1=Adding shrapnel to bombs is very effective at elimiting ones fellow critters of the land. But there can be more insane carnage.^A mixture of magma cream can release a massive blast of pure flame upon detonation. Refined magma cream burns at such a high temperature few can withstand its blast.
knowledge.firebomb.2=How it works is the magma cream (being a mixture of burning embers and sticky slime) is able to keep a self-sustaining flame while remaining as a spreadable substance. Additional blaze powder then reacts with a dragon heart to release a magical catalyst that increases the temperature of the flame.
knowledge.firebomb.3=Incineration bombs may be expensive, but their extremely effective against armour.

knowledge.bombCeramic=Ceramic Bomb Casing
knowledge.bombCeramic.desc=Basic Bombs
knowledge.bombCeramic.1=Bombs are one of the simplest forms of explosives: Just throw it and it explodes.^Ceramic casings however are brittle and don't restrict the blast much. Bombs made from these will have an average explosion radius.

knowledge.mineCeramic=Ceramic Mine Casing
knowledge.mineCeramic.desc=Basic Mines
knowledge.mineCeramic.1=Mines aren't as useful as your conventional bomb but still have their place. A mine will explode when something walks near it.^Ceramic cases are brittle and unstable, this means their both sensetive and don't restrict blasts much. Ceramic mines have an average explosion radius.

knowledge.bombIron=Iron Bomb Casing
knowledge.bombIron.desc=Compacted Blasts
knowledge.bombIron.1=It normally would be wise to make a bomb easy to detonate... But why not let it build up some pressure?^Iron casings take a bit more force to break. This means when they do detonate the explosion(though smaller) has a bit more force behind it. 

knowledge.mineIron=Iron Mine Casing
knowledge.mineIron.desc=Compacted Blasts
knowledge.mineIron.1=Ceramic casings may bit too sensetive. Iron bomb casings not only allow the blast to build more pressure, but their solid construction makes them harder to trigger, reducing their range but increasing their damage.

knowledge.bombObsidian=Obisidian Bomb Casing
knowledge.bombObsidian.desc=Sealing in the freshness
knowledge.bombObsidian.1=You've taken one step with iron bombs, but why not go further?^Obsidian bombs restrict the blast so much the range is tiny, but the resulting blast is highly damaging.

knowledge.mineObsidian=Obisidian Mine Casing
knowledge.mineObsidian.desc=Sealing in the freshness
knowledge.mineObsidian.1=Mines may not be as useful as bombs, but they can pack a suprising punch.^Obsidian mines are hard and not very sensetive. These are only set off when something practically is standing on it... But that just means more of a lethal result.

knowledge.bombCrystal=Crystal Bomb Casing
knowledge.bombCrystal.desc=Stylish
knowledge.bombCrystal.1=Reducing the blast radius to focus more on damage seems decent, but why not increase the blast radius?^Glass casings have no resistence meaning all the power spreads as far as possible.^And add some diamond into the mix so the shards cause more damage anyway!

knowledge.mineCrystal=Crystal Mine Casing
knowledge.mineCrystal.desc=Stylish
knowledge.mineCrystal.1=A delicate glass mine. This can be set off real easy with a large explosion.^Not only that but adding diamond shards into the workings of the case just makes it hurt all the more (and by that I mean the person who stands on it, not the fact it cost you a diamond to make).

knowledge.bombFuse=Bomb Fuses
knowledge.bombFuse.desc=Timed destruction
knowledge.bombFuse.1=What's a bomb without a fuse? A massively blown up hand! Fuses are a vital part of any explosive devices, even mines use them to some extent.^The fuse you create determines how long until the device explodes.
knowledge.bombFuse.2=You can also make an extended fuse. With this: bombs can be thrown much farther before exploding. Not much use on mines though...

knowledge.stickybomb=Sticky Bombs
knowledge.stickybomb.desc=Catch this!
knowledge.stickybomb.1=Sticky bombs- as the name might suggest, are bombs that are sticky. And with this amazing trait: will attatch themselves to whatever poor sod gets in its way.^So what you have here is a bomb that does a lot of damage sticking to someone! Which never stops being funny.
knowledge.stickybomb.2=To create these: Leave(or put) a bomb in the output slot and right-click the block with a slime ball. A single slimeball can coat a stack of any size.

knowledge.cogArmour=Cogwork Suit
knowledge.cogArmour.desc=Power Armor
knowledge.cogArmour.1=Heavy armour has its limits, it may provide substantial protection but at a cost of mobility.^Cogwork suits use the momentum generated through complex contraptions to aid movement. Wearers of these suits will have increased strength, reducing stamina decay.
knowledge.cogArmour.2=A basic frame of this suit may not offer much protection, but it greatly reduces fall damage and reduces stamina cost from actions, while the helmet filters smoke, meaning you suffer no negative effects from exposure.
knowledge.cogArmour.mechanics.1=$hUse of Cogworks$r^Alone, single pieces of cogwork are extremely heavy and impossible to move in.^You need to have a chest, legs and boots all equipped in order for the suit to function. Not only that; but the chest needs fuel to move the suit in the first place.
knowledge.cogArmour.mechanics.2=The helmet is not required for the suit to function, but since the suit generates smoke, it's good to protect yourself.^In total: These suits are so heavy, swimming becomes inpossible, be careful.
knowledge.cogArmour.fuel=$hRefueling$r^As mentioned: The chest piece needs to be fuelled to function. In order to do this the chest piece must be unequipped, then used while sneaking. You need coke in your inventory which are consumed for fuel.
knowledge.cogArmour.armour=With further refinement you are also able to create a super heavy, and powerful plating for cogwork suits. This plating upgrade grants superior resistance against all forms of damage. This can be made from nearly any metal and can greatly affect its properties.

knowledge.compPlate=Composite Alloy
knowledge.compPlate.desc=Powerful all-rounder
knowledge.compPlate.1=When weight and clutter aren't an issue, there's more time to focus on the performance of armour. Regular metals by themselves have ups and downs and it's hard to get it perfect.
knowledge.compPlate.2=This composite alloy combines multiple materials to create a hard, and solid material that is better than the sum of its parts. This alloy can compete with materials higher than its own. This can then be added to cogwork frames to create a suit of powerful protection.

knowledge.refined_planks=Refined Planks
knowledge.refined_planks.desc=Structually stable
knowledge.refined_planks.1=Refined planks are both strong and resistent to weathering and should prove a decent building material. By nailing some of these together, you can make a block for building. This block cannot be taken apart.^You can also make this out of normal planks.

knowledge.reinforced_stone=Reinforced Stone
knowledge.reinforced_stone.desc=Heavy Duty
knowledge.reinforced_stone.1=Stone is a useful material being strong, non-flammable and resists explosions. You can however, increase the capabilities of stone by melting some obsidian and kaolinite with it.^You will not need an ingot mould to retrieve this from the crucible.

knowledge.clay_wall=Clay Pannel
knowledge.clay_wall.desc=Decorative Walls
knowledge.clay_wall.1=These walls are mainly for decorative purposes. Excellent for 2-story buildings and lining rooftops.

knowledge.glass=Glass Blocks
knowledge.glass.desc=Decorative Windows
knowledge.glass.1=Glass is decorative, but extremely fragile. Putting a frame around glass not only improves its strength, but allows it to be picked up safely without ruining its shape.

knowledge.brickworks=Basic Brickworks
knowledge.brickworks.desc=Expanded stone
knowledge.brickworks.1=There's more than one way to build with stone. Dirt and stone can make bricks and pavement.

knowledge.bars=Metal Bars
knowledge.bars.desc=Strong Fencing
knowledge.bars.1=These bars are great for letting light in while remaining strong. Bars can be made out of common materials (not rare or exotic though).^It however is possible to make dragonforge bars that burn what touches it.

knowledge.thatch=Thatch
knowledge.thatch.desc=Soft Roofing
knowledge.thatch.1=Simple roofing made from grass. These go well with mud bricks and are easy to make.

knowledge.paint_brush=Paint Brush
knowledge.paint_brush.desc=Spreading finish
knowledge.paint_brush.1=It has come to your attention the obvious fact that spreading oil with your hands is just messy. You need a paint brush.^Paint brushes can refine planks much more efficiently and can be used to apply oil to pre-existing plank blocks.
knowledge.paint_brush.2=$hPainting In-World$r^To save the trouble of going to the workbench every time, you can also paint some blocks in-game, So long as you have plant oil in your inventory, right-click blocks such as Nailed Planks to turn it into refined blocks.

knowledge.decorated_stone=Decorated Stone
knowledge.decorated_stone.desc=Metal Trimming
knowledge.decorated_stone.1=Stone can look bland in large quantaties, so you've learnt to trim reinforced stone with metals, adding just a little bit of style to your walls.

knowledge.generic_meat=Generic Meat
knowledge.generic_meat.desc=Good for any recipe
knowledge.generic_meat.1=There's a lot of meat out there. But sometimes, it shouldn't matter. Generic meat is made from a variety of meat types cooked or uncooked, used for easier storage and use in recipes.^You're better off preparing raw meat, as some can give additional output.

knowledge.stew=Stew
knowledge.stew.desc=Kind of bland
knowledge.stew.1=You're no cook... not yet anyway. Stew is the food of the novice. Just throw some diced meat in a bowl and call it a meal! Stew can be made from steak, chicken, pork wolf, horse and even fish.

knowledge.jerky=Jerky
knowledge.jerky.desc=For the traveller
knowledge.jerky.1=Jerky may not be the tastiest or warmest of food, but it has its own purpose. This is one of the few stackable foods and has a decent stamina bonus across the board. Good for mining trips and explorations.

knowledge.saussage=Saussage
knowledge.saussage.desc=Sealed meats
knowledge.saussage.1=When rationing meats into jerky, you tend to sacrifice pleasure of consumption for practicality. No more chewy, salty, jerky! Saussages keep meat fresh in a casing made from... uh... entrails...

knowledge.sandwitch=Sandwitches
knowledge.sandwitch.desc=Simple
knowledge.sandwitch.1=A piece of meat in between some bread, how could you not have known this before! Sandwitches though not stackable can be eaten twice.

knowledge.sandwitchBig=Big Sandwitch
knowledge.sandwitchBig.desc=Extra long
knowledge.sandwitchBig.1=You can now make sandwitches out of whole loafs of bread with more filling. These have 4 uses.

knowledge.meatpie=Meat Pie
knowledge.meatpie.desc=Hearty and filling
knowledge.meatpie.1=What's better than putting meat in a pie? nothing! Meat pies are filling and give a high stamina buff. Place the pie block and right-click with a knife to cut a slice.

knowledge.shepardpie=Shepards Pie
knowledge.shepardpie.desc=You can eat it if you're not a shepard too
knowledge.shepardpie.1=Even better than a meat pie, now with potato! And a bigger stamina buff. Place the pie block and right-click with a knife to cut a slice.

knowledge.salt=Salt
knowledge.salt.desc=A little extra
knowledge.salt.1=Salt is an additive for cooking sometimes used. To create salt, first gather some salt water.^Salt water is gathered by right-clicking a a Clay Pot on water that is directly above sand(such as a beach). Then cook this to produce salt.
knowledge.salt.2=Clay pots are able to handle constant carrying and dying of salt water without decaying. These are used to gather salt water.^Salt water is detemined by being directly above sand OR being a beach/ocean biome.

knowledge.jug=Jug
knowledge.jug.desc=Liquid Storage
knowledge.jug.1=Food can be picky with quantities, due to this, and the fact you can't carry liquids, jugs will be used. Jugs can store milk, water and oil.
knowledge.jug.2=Water can be gathered similar to buckets through right-click, but can also be converted from buckets. Milk cannot be obtained directly from cows.

knowledge.bread=Bread And Pastry
knowledge.bread.desc=Grainy
knowledge.bread.1=Bread may be a boring meal alone, but can be used in conjunction with other, more interesting food.^Flour however can be used for making all kinds of pastries.
knowledge.bread.other=Some recipes (such as bread as mentioned before) have alternate recipes, though are still inferior to MF food.

knowledge.oats=Oats
knowledge.oats.desc=Wholesome and basic
knowledge.oats.1=Not all meals are fancy multi-food mixtures. Keep it simple with this mixture of natural grains.

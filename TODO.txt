//:Re-Implement Hot items:\\
Make it the same as MFI, only try limit searching the hot list for items
Instead create NBT variables(maxtemp, workabletemp, etc) on creation.
(The old system lagged a bit when lots of ingots were used)


//:New Blocks(Construction):\\
Limestone bricks
Reinforced Stone|Bricks
Stairs/Slabs
Roads (Mattock Roads)
Lantern
Storage Blocks later (Like safes even lockable chests and doors)


//:Skills and Research:\\
Rather than a research system that seems grindy and unsatisfying, it may be fitting to add RPG elements
to the mod, just a simple system like the mcmmo plugin would suffice, the research points could be
added automatically when gaining the proper skills, or with perk points (or config), as you do stuff or
find scrolls you gain skills, skills can be things like Smithing, Cooking, Melee, Ranged, Defense, etc.


//:Adding Slag:\\
I've not really been in to adding slag, but if it could be made into a liquid and
output through some kind of system and dumped, that may make it worth adding,
Same thing with smoke, making it an upside-down liquid(like thaumcraft fluxgas)


//:Research Fields:\\
Basic (Research, Information, etc)
Smithing (Smelting, Refining, Alloying, Weapon, Tool, Armour, etc)
Construction (Blocks for decor)
Engineering (Bombs, Mines, Crossbows)
Cooking (Food)
Mastery (Combat, Stats, etc)
Alchemy (Potions)


//:Alchemy Stuff:\\
A large selection of biome-specific herbs, mob drops, etc
Potions made will have no stacking but multiple uses (kind of like botanica)
Potions can also have tiers for better ingreedients
